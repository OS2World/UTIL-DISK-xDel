    INTRODUCTION
    ============

    Welcome to xDel. This is a program I wrote to allow myself to easily
    delete a lot of temporal files. To allow this I needed a program that
    supports piping. I think the support for piping is what sets this
    program apart from other programs like rm.

    xDel is a very powerful program and it supports everything you would
    expect from a deletion tool. This power however also makes it easy to
    make fatal mistakes. I think it is important to say right here that
    this program is released as free OpenSource software and comes without
    any warranty. It is published under the GNU public License and you can
    find the license in the file COPYING. Having said that, I don't think
    the program can cause damage when used properly, I tested the program
    in real life situations at my own computer. To make the best use of the
    program and to avoid fatal mistakes I strongly urge you to read this
    document completely. It provides vital information on how to set up
    your configuration.

    People who want a quick start I strongly urge to really read this
    document completely, but if you really don't have time you should at
    least read the sections INSTALLATION, COMMAND LINE OPTIONS and KNOWN
    LIMITATIONS. This will provide you with the information you need to
    avoid fatal mistakes.

    If you want you can print this document on a printer. It is prepared
    for a layout of 55 lines and 80 columns


xDel README - 2. INSTALLATION                                            page 3

    INSTALLATION
    ============

    Installation of xDel is quite straight forward. The program is
    distributed as a single zip file, which you can extract with info-zip's
    unzip. (But since you are reading this file, you probably already did
    that). To extract the files type at your command line

      unzip xDel.zip

    I suggest you place the files in their own subdirectory and add that
    directory to your path in the CONFIG.SYS. If you didn't already extract
    the files to their own directory you can move them to another directory
    with the OS/2 command move.

    After extracting you will have the following files:

      COPYING
      makefile
      README
      xDel.c
      xDel.def
      xDel.exe
      xDel.h

    COPYING contains the GNU General Public License, README is this file
    you are reading right now and xDel.exe is the program executable. The
    other files contain the source code of xDel and are only relevant if
    you want to recompile the program yourself, or want to use the code.

    Now you have extracted the files you should add the directory in which
    you extracted the program to your PATH in the CONFIG.SYS. I would
    advise to add the directory at the end of the PATH statement. At the
    same time you should consider adding

      SET XDEL_OPTIONS=/i

    or at least

      SET XDEL_OPTIONS=/v

    to your CONFIG.SYS. XDEL_OPTIONS is a environment variable and contains
    options for xDel. The option /i tells xDel to confirm every deletion
    with a simple yes/no question. The option /v tells xDel to display all
    the names of the files it deletes. By setting one of these options you
    can allow yourself to familiarize yourself with the program and see
    whether it is doing what you want it to do. When you feel more
    comfortable with the program you can change the options.

    That is all what is needed to install xDel. You should reboot OS/2 to
    make the new settings in your CONFIG.SYS active, or you should type the
    following commands every time you open a OS/2 command line:

xDel README - 2. INSTALLATION                                            page 4

      SET XDEL_OPTIONS=<options>
      SET PATH=%PATH%;<xdel_path>

    Where you should replace <options> with the options you want to be
    active all the time, and <xdel_path> with the full path of the
    directory in which you installed xDel.


xDel README - 3. COMMAND LINE OPTIONS                                    page 5

    COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
    ====================

    xDel has several command line options which define how the program
    operates. All the options can be placed anywhere on the command line
    and are active only for the file specifications that occur after the
    option. The command line options are the same as the options in the
    XDEL_OPTIONS environment variable, and are in addition to these
    options.

    A typical command line for xDel could look like this:

      [C:]xDel /s test\*.* /r /f temp\*.* temp

    In this case the /s option would be used for test\*.* as well as for
    temp\*.* and temp. The options /r and /f would both be used for
    temp\*.* and temp only. This command would delete all files in the
    directory test and its subdirectories (/s option), but leave the
    directory structure intact and hidden, system or readonly files would
    not be deleted. However for the directory temp it would not only delete
    all file, including hidden, system and readonly files (because of /f),
    but also delete the subdirectories. Finally it would delete the
    directory temp itself too.

    xDel can give you a list of command line options if you add the /h or
    /? command line option. The full list of options is as follows:

      /f        Forced deletion
      /h or /?  Help
      /i        Interactive mode
      /r        Remove subdirectories
      /s        Recurse into subdirectories
      /u        Unrecoverable delete
      /v        Verbose mode
      /-        Read filenames from standard input

    The command line options can be mixed with file specifications, where
    only the options that come before the file specifications are used. In
    this way you can use different options for different file
    specifications. The file specifications are composed of normal
    characters and the two standard OS/2 wildcards ? and *. The ? stands
    for only one character, while * stands for any series of characters.

    A explanation of the options follows:

      /f        Forced deletion

    If the /f option is given xDel will delete also any file with the
    hidden, read-only or system attribute set. If the option is not given
    read-only files will cause a Access denied error and hidden or system
    files will simply be ignored.


xDel README - 3. COMMAND LINE OPTIONS                                    page 6

      /h or /?  Help

    The /h or /? options prints a short help message on screen with all the
    command line options. /h and /? are actually the same, but both are
    supported, because there is no real convention to use either /? or /h.

      /i        Interactive mode

    Interactive mode allows you to confirm the deletion of each separate
    file. xDel will ask you to confirm the deletion of each file with a
    simple Y(es) or N(o) question.

      /r        Remove subdirectories

    The /r option instructs xDel to remove subdirectories that math the
    file specification too. The subdirectories will only be deleted if they
    are empty, otherwise a access denied error message will be given. xDel
    will not recurse into subdirectories when the /r option is given. To
    let xDel recurse into subdirectories you should give the /s option.

      /s        Recurse into subdirectories

    The /s option instructs xDel to recurse into subdirectories and delete
    all the files that match the file specification in the subdirectories
    too. The /s option does not instruct xDel to delete subdirectories
    itself. For example if you give the command xDel /s temp\test.* it will
    delete all files that start with test. in the directory temp and all
    files that start with test. in the subdirectories of temp, but it will
    not delete a subdirectory test of the directory temp.

      /u        Unrecoverable delete

    If this option is given xDelete will use the DosForceDelete function,
    and it will be impossible to recover files with undelete.

      /v        Verbose mode

    The /v option instructs xDel to print the name of the file on stdout,
    which is usually the screen.

      /-        Read filenames from standard input

    The /- option tells xDel to read, in addition to the command line, file
    specifications from stdin. stdin is usually the keyboard input, but it
    can also be input from a pipe, as in the following example:

      dir temp\*.* /s /b /-p | xDel /-

    In this example it will get the output from the dir command and delete
    all files in the temp directory and its subdirectories.



xDel README - 4. ENVIRONMENT SETTINGS                                    page 7

    ENVIRONMENT SETTINGS
    ====================

    Before parsing the command line xDel will look for the environment
    variable XDEL_OPTIONS, and if it is available use the options sepcified
    in this variable for all file specifications. It is not possible to
    negate any option in the XDEL_OPTIONS with a command line option. If
    you want to negate an option you should use the beginlocal and endlocal
    options of the OS/2 Command line interpreter CMD.EXE. The options are
    the same as on the command line and each option has to be separated
    from the next by a whitespace.


xDel README - 5. KNOWN LIMITATIONS                                       page 8

    KNOWN LIMITATIONS
    =================

    xDel has a few limitations, however none of them do limit the use of
    the application.

    It is impossible to negate command line options so you should take
    care of the order in which command line options are placed. Sometimes
    it might be necessary to split up the job in two or more parts.

    If you specify the name of a directory to delete, a directory will only
    be deleted if it is empty. To delete the directory and its contents you
    should first specify to delete all contents of the directory and then
    the directory itself. For example:

      xDel /s /r test\*.* test

    Is the proper command to delete the directory test and its contents.
    This is different from the way del or rm work, but seen the power of
    the program this is a safety precaution.
